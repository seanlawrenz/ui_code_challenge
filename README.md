UI code challenge for Updox

Background:
The provider directory helps healthcare providers find and connect with other healthcare providers.  It acts as a personal address book of provider email addresses.  Specialty is very important when searching as providers often look for available providers within in a particular specialty.

Should have the ability to create providers that will immediately prepend to the list on submit.
